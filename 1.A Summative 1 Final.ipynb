I remember the first miscarriage right after the ultrasound was devastating, and we were so worried when we saw the peanut that would become my healthy, exuberant son. My wife and I are mostly pro-birth for ourselves, but, when we were in our birthing years, we also acknowledged that we didn't have the funds or mental bandwidth to care for an extreme special needs child. I don't think that decision (with the genetic roll of dice) should have precluded us from having children, and should such situation have arrived, we would have sought a family willing to take on the burden of raising such a child. However, there are diseases and conditions even more insidious that could have created a child whose entire existence was suffering and looming death or even the death of my spouse. By the time we would have had that information in much later term, we would have had a nursery decorated, a name picked out, and it would have been a devastating, difficult decision. I'm glad we never had to make it.  Saying that if you don't want to be confronted with that decision, then you shouldn't even get pregnant is ridiculous (which you didn't say but I have heard enough). It's the equivalent of saying that if you can't stand to lose money, then you shouldn't start a business. We start by avoiding risk, and if that's not feasible then we try to mitigate and minimize it. We can't have a world where risks are not taken, but we can ensure that the risks do not define a person should luck turn.  The death of a independently viable child would be a travesty, and I don't think that there are many who would advocate for it.  TL;DR: Abortions are a choice but aren't exclusive to women who don't want children. The Venn diagram overlaps, but it isn't a circle.\",\n",

I get that many of them don\\'t want be prejudiced or racist, but the fact that they are ignorant their support of the republican party produces more systemic racism than supporting democrats (have to say more here, because the democratic party is by no means a cure for racism but certainly the better of two options - simple case in point is trump reversing bias awareness training for law enforcement and record numbers of conservatives polled as delusionally believing racial inequality does exist in USA). In being ignorant they further a racist agenda and don\\'t want to deal with the reality that racism is prevalent, and hence their ignorance is racist.

To take a really extreme example look at the fallout from Nazi germany (sorry things often come back to this but it provides the best example I can think of). The country felt a unified shame for what they had allowed to happen with Hitler and recognize it and teach it in schools so they don't fall into the same nationalist autocratic pitfall again.

He also helped Obama build the cages. Not that I care about either because I'm not affected nor is my family. But you really have to research each candidate and stop relying on your feelings to cloud objective judgement. Stay away from books written by partisan authors, they do not offer any actual facts, both pro-trump and anti-trump.  You can also research the positive things Trump has done.

       " 'I disagree, fundamentally, that I\\'ve been manipulated and brainwashed. I don\\'t use media, or reporting or anything like that to formulate my opinion of Trump. Listening to him talk, and tweet is all I really need to know. Anything of merit he has done, is outweighed heavily by the way he carries himself. He is not a strong leader, I believe. The message he sends in comparison to the message Biden sends, is just not good for our country. Trump is divisive, negative and attacks other Americans, simply because they are not on \"his side\". I believe, that weakens us as a country, United we stand divided we fall and all that.  To me, this is obvious. It\\'s not a product of my feelings, or propaganda, it\\'s simply common sense I believe. You can go back and watch any presidential speech in modern times, and then watch a trump speech and notice the jarring difference. I would say 75-85% of a presidents job, is that of a figure head. Trump is awful at that, and he reinforces partisan politics, racism and sexism. The failure to concede, unlike every single losing presidential candidate has done before him is a great example of that. He is a threat to our democracy at this point.

I don\\'t need a news report to understand this, I just simply need to listen to the man talk.  He is far to concerned about himself, and in my opinion, having empathy, is a core requirement of the job of being the president. I don\\'t see any empathy from that man.  So given all of that, I would have voted for anyone whom isn\\'t trump, and I feel he is far and away the worst president we have ever had in modern history. If you can\\'t see that, you have either not been paying attention, you\\'re willingly blind to it, or you yourself have let yourself become manipulated or brainwashed.  &#x200B;  Also in regards to your point about Biden taxing social security in 1988, he didn\\'t sign off on anything, the bill had bipartisan support. Here ya go buddy, since you don\\'t even look into your own facts you\\'re spouting off.  &#x200B;   [https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/posts-mislead-on-bidens-role-in-social-security-taxes/](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/posts-mislead-on-bidens-role-in-social-security-taxes/)  **“Prior to 1983, social security was not taxable. Joe Biden voted successfully in favor of taxing 50% of social security.”**  That’s not the whole story. Biden was one of 88 senators who voted for a bipartisan bill in 1983 to tax up to 50% of Social Security for beneficiaries with income above a certain threshold. That vote came at a time when the Social Security trust fund for retirement benefits was running out of money.  In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan, with congressional leaders, convened a bipartisan commission to study the issue. In 1983, that [commission issued a report](https://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan.html#:~:text=JANUARY%201983,Security%20faced%20at%20that%20time.) that formed the basis for amendments to the Social Security program. Among the [recommendations](https://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan5.html) in the report was that benefits be taxed as income for recipients who had income over a certain threshold.  Congress set that [threshold](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v46n7/v46n7p3.pdf) a little higher than recommended, at $25,000 for single people and $32,000 for married couples. That would be equivalent to about $64,000 and $82,000 today, adjusted for inflation using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index [calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm).  A Senate Finance Committee [report](https://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/Downey%20PDFs/Social%20Security%20Amendments%20of%201983%20Vol%202.pdf) issued in March 1983 said that the bill would assure that those with low incomes wouldn’t pay taxes, but those with “substantial taxable income from other sources” would be taxed on some of the benefits they receive.  The income thresholds weren’t indexed to inflation, though. So, as time went on, inflation would rise but the thresholds would remain the same, [effectively](https://www.ssa.gov/history/taxationofbenefits.html#:~:text=Congress%20passed%20and%20President%20Reagan,rules%20adopted%20in%201983%20were%3A&text=Effective%20for%20taxable%20years%20beginning%20after%201983.) lowering the bar that was intended to keep low-income beneficiaries from being taxed and adding more beneficiaries to the tax rolls.  It should also be noted that the thresholds weren’t a hard line above which everyone would be treated the same. [Rather](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL32552), the bill set out a formula with a gradual increase in the amount of benefits eligible to be taxed, which maxed out at half of a recipient’s benefits.  All of the taxes collected on those benefits would go [back into the Social Security coffers](https://www.ssa.gov/history/taxationofbenefits.html#:~:text=Congress%20passed%20and%20President%20Reagan,rules%20adopted%20in%201983%20were%3A&text=Effective%20for%20taxable%20years%20beginning%20after%201983.).  The bill that included that change to the program passed in a [bipartisan vote](https://voteview.com/rollcall/RS0980053) in 1983. Biden was one of 88 senators who voted for it. Only nine senators voted against it.  When Reagan signed the bill into law, he praised the bipartisan effort in his remarks and was joined by members of both parties. “This bill demonstrates for all time our nation’s ironclad commitment to Social Security,” [he said](https://www.ssa.gov/history/reaganstmts.html#1983).  Today, about half of Social Security recipients pay no federal income tax on their benefits, according to a June 12 [report](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11397) from the Congressional Research Service. [When the law was passed](https://www.ssa.gov/history/taxationofbenefits.html#:~:text=Congress%20passed%20and%20President%20Reagan,rules%20adopted%20in%201983%20were%3A&text=Effective%20for%20taxable%20years%20beginning%20after%201983.), about 10% of recipients owed taxes on their benefits. So, the portion of those affected has risen, although it’s far from including everyone.  **---> So it’s true that Biden voted to tax some Social Security benefits. But the social media posts leave out the fact that the law had overwhelming bipartisan support, wouldn’t apply to all beneficiaries and would only tax 50% of benefits at the upper end of a sliding scale. <---**  **“In 1993, Joe Biden was the deciding vote in raising taxes on social security from 50% to 85%.”**  In this case, the change was part of a [major tax bill](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/laws-proposals/major-enacted-tax-legislation-1990-1999) that President Bill Clinton had laid out in his [State of](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/WCPD-1993-02-22/pdf/WCPD-1993-02-22-Pg215-2.pdf) [the Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840MahAgJh0) [address](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/economic-commentary-archives/1993-economic-commentaries/ec-19931015-the-budget-reconciliation-act-of-1993-a-summary-report.aspx) in February 1993.  Among its provisions was an increase to the amount of Social Security benefits that could be taxed for some recipients. The way this claim is phrased, though, it sounds like the benefits are subject to an 85% tax rate. That’s not right.  This change to the Social Security program was structured similarly to the 1983 change. It added another bracket to the income thresholds and increased the portion of benefits eligible to be taxed if recipients exceeded the second-tier thresholds. Under this bill, single recipients with income over $34,000 and married couples making more than $44,000 could pay income tax on *up to* 85% of their Social Security benefits.  The tax bill, which included several controversial changes, was highly partisan. Not a single Republican voted in favor of it.  Biden [voted for the bill](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&session=1&vote=00247), along with the majority of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate.  He wasn’t the “deciding vote,” though. The Senate vote was tied, 50-50, and Vice President Al Gore [cast the deciding vote](https://www.ssa.gov/history/InternetMyths2.html#:~:text=In%201993%2C%20legislation%20was%20enacted,to%20%22higher%20income%22%20beneficiaries.).  We [addressed](https://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/social-security-scare/) another claim related to this issue when Sen. Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign pointed to Biden’s vote on the 1993 bill. The Romney campaign had failed to mention, as do the current social media posts, that the additional tax revenue would go into the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund — which was rapidly depleting.  ***--> So, it’s true that Biden voted for an increase in the amount of Social Security benefits that could be taxed for some recipients, but it didn’t apply to all recipients and he wasn’t the “deciding vote.”<--***',\n",

Only liberals are allowing this to happen to them.  >Are there racists on the right? Yes, but the same argument applies.  I\\'d like to give you an unbiased viewpoint here at least in defense to the racism in both sides. The argument of racism at least in my viewpoint is that it should be allowed. I\\'m Latino, and I think racism is inherently a right of free thinking. An overt racist is at least kind enough to let you know he/she is discriminatory, it\\'s worse they don\\'t let you know and manipulate you.   Apart from that, let\\'s just assume attempts are made to \"fix\" racism, then you are attempting to \"fix\" free thinking, which is inherently impossible. For example, take a local store manager, this store manager is racist against Asians. Let\\'s say this racist store manager takes legally enforced \"training\"  to stop being racist against Asians(which by the way is an act of tyranny, and tyranny is defined as an action taken that is cruel and oppressive), it won\\'t change the fact that the manager is still racist.  People tend to protest said racism, but don\\'t realize that in demanding to take a role under the manager in question, would effectively have them working for the person they hate the most. Only this time the legal effort taken to stop the racism has made it from overt to covert.  Likewise racism, and in my case, my discrimination against Black people isn\\'t rooted in a superiority complex, I don\\'t think my race is better and don\\'t believe in segregation, in fact I love beautiful black women I seriously have the hots for Mona Kosar Abdul at ABC news where I work; and have a lot of black friends, and my best friend while in college who now lives in Cali, is an African American from Egypt. My discrimination is rooted in the gang life of the local Bloods and Vice Lords in my neighborhood, to say I hate black people because of their skin color is absurd and I find thinking in that manner is actually a disservice to anyone in 2020, especially in the Northeastern region.  I\\'ve experienced racism myself, I\\'ve had black people tell me \"you stink like a mexican\". I\\'ve been ostracized for \"not being Dominican enough\", I\\'ve been called a \"lazy Dominican\", so yes in that sense, you are right about there being racism. It\\'s all just freedom of speech in the end as long as it\\'s speech, whether you let it decide your fate is up to you.    That being said I think every human being should have the right to hate anyone for anything. It is part of our liberty; remember life, LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.

You are creating a huge generalization of the liberal viewpoint by saying only their opinions are influenced by the media.

You can\\'t just tell someone \"hey stop thinking like that\" and expect them to stop. However, every individual is shaped by their upbringing, their education, their peers, etc. Why do you discriminate other races? Because of your past experiences with other races, whether it be things you have witnessed in person, seen on TV, etc. I think we can agree that racism is not good on a societal level. It makes it harder for certain races to succeed, as if they are set up to fail from the day they are born. This in turn leads to certain races living in poverty, committing more violent crimes, etc. This in turn ultimately leads to your discrimination against this race. Everyone should have an equal opportunity to be successful, get a good education, and not face discrimination. To summarize: You don\\'t solve racism and discrimination by telling people not to be racist. You solve it by giving underprivileged races a chance to succeed, and eventually, over generations, things will improve.  > I only tell you this because this is probably the only time you\\'ll visit r/Conservatives  Lastly, I think this is another random generalization / comment that only contributes to the divide between two political parties.

And yes, America is not a direct democracy etc etc but you must see why people may have felt justified in marching, protesting.

I heard someone from Scotland say that \"There\\'s no point in voting when you live here, because London has twice the population.\" It\\'s those kinds of scenarios the electoral college is supposed to help prevent.

And arguing that you should get your state’s percentage of EVs based off popular vote is basically admitting we should just do popular vote.  The EC was supposed to protect us from a populist demagogue who promised people everything they wanted but in no way could deliver. That happened on 2016 and the electors were basically “LOL fuck your feelings.” The other fear that led to the EV was one large state (VA) just voting itself more power or resources from smaller states. That fear isn’t really rational anymore with 50 states. It really is a relic of a bygone era.',\n",

In many states ONLY the electoral college could vote for the president and vice president.  The only reason the electoral college does what it does now is because we fixed the size of the house at 435 way back in 1929. This has created a lot of problems tho. Now, Republicans are barely represented in any major cities. If the house were larger, house representatives would be representing less people and a minority voice wouldn\\'t be drowned out (assuming we get rid of gerrymandering).  Obviously it\\'s more complicated than just getting rid of the electoral college, but reform to how votes are represented needs to be made into a more stable and intentional system. If you put me on the spot, I\\'d say that it should be total ranked popular vote, and go back to 1^st place president with 2^nd place vice president; while giving the vice president slightly more power in the Senate than they currently have. That way voting for candidates who want to work across the aisle, and with 3rd parties is incentivized, along with voting for younger healthier more in touch presidents.

I hope that's because Trump's abrasive personality meant there wasn't a friendly, charismatic face on the overreaches and injustices of the state. I hope liberals will hold Biden to as much scrutiny now they've learned what the state is up to. Time will tell.  More likely we'll just see a flip.

And there is a conservative majority in the Supreme Court.   As long as the GOP holds the Senate, the Democrats can’t pack the Supreme Court to negate the conservative majority there.   And as long as we hold the Senate *and* the Supreme Court, all the unconstitutional crap on their wishlist will get tossed out.   I would have preferred Trump remaining in the White House as a stop measure against (the usual) Democratic Party overreach.  But I’ll settle with a Senate majority and a Supreme Court that actually recognizes limits to government power.   Hopefully, if the Democrats go too far (again, as they usually do), they’ll piss off enough voters to potentially flip the House in 2022.  And if that happens, we don’t have to worry about a White House trying to legislate through executive orders the way Obama did; not with a solid backstop in the Supreme Court to prevent it.   Biden winning isn’t an ideal result.  But if our Senate majority stays - and I think it will - the very worst of Democratic Party nonsense will be kept in check.

Little anecdote about the climate change: 2 months ago i visited Iceland and went for a guided glacier tour with an expert in that field who does this tours for 40+ years. He says he cant understand why everyone is going nuts about the climate getting warmer and warmer. It is a normal cycle and everything that happens now happened before. Carbon emissions just accelerate this process but not by the amount everyone wants us to believe it. He said the earth will get warmer and glaciers are going to melt and eventually the temperatures will go down again. Humans cant really change anything about it. Just accelerate/decelerate the process.  To me it also sounded wierd at first but after some time it kind of makes sense.  And I trust this Expert more than a little 16yo child screaming and shouting in TV just for some publicity.  Dont get me wrong: this doesnt mean we should ignore the environment! We need to treat nature with respect since we are only guests on mother earth.',\n",
       " \" I don't think you should base your positions in Greta either 😂  Now the glacier guy is technically right in everything he says. But the accerating/decelerating thing is actually EXTREMELY significant! Normally it takes many thousands, maybe even millions of years for the temperature to change by a couple degrees. Our influence is on track to do the same in 100 or less!   (I assume you have a basic understanding of evolution here) This is devastating to many eco systems, since mutations take a lot longer to compound into something meaningful! As a result many species will have a risk of going (or have already went :( ) extinct, this could be anywhere from 5-90% (i'm just *some saying that I have at the tip of my tongue, but can't quite remember*. Basically I haven't heard any experts say this, just a rough estimate by me)  of species depending on how sustainable/lucky we are. Furthermore climate change makes the weather more extreme and it is worst in places where humans already have it rough. Droughts and tsunami will kill many people and destroy their homes. They will have massive damage bills to pay, while USA can sit back, because they have the resources to deal with what's happening to them, atleast so far.   For someone like Trump, there is no real egotistical argument for controlling climate change, since he will almost certainly die before it will ever have an impact on him. But tons of people around the world are already feeling the consequences. And the north/western world will too. It probably cheapest and smartest to just deal with it now\",\n",

The hard part is finding a solution that is doing that while not destroying the economy. imo the Paris climate deal was a flop since everybody pretty much didnt care about it and i also think the green new deal will be a total failure. but the way the media makes us think we are all going to die by 2040 is just insane. This is a huge problem and we can only fix it if every human being on earth works together... that will be the most challenging part',\n",

       " 'So “poll watchers” are a real thing that happens every year and is regulated. Both dem and repub campaigns select people from each district who are then official poll watchers that go and basically observe the process and report anything suspicious to the election board. One example from a previous legitimate poll watcher I’ve seen was that they noticed one of the workers using code words to send Dems and repubs to different machines, even though it wasn’t a primary where voting separately was needed. Things like that.   However, this year the term has been muddied. Trump asked his supporters to be “poll watchers” from the podium several times, often saying “everyone” should be poll watchers, and making it sound as though anyone who wants can show up to any polling place without warning and be allowed to stand over everyone’s shoulders to watch the process. This, expectedly, led to swaths of people across the country trying to do just this. However, since they were not *legal, legit* poll watchers, they could be — and were, in many places — kicked out of the polling place. Voter intimidation is illegal after all (or used to be, at least /sigh) and if you are not a registered official poll watcher, you cannot just hang out in a polling place and stare over voters. Especially decked in political gear and arms as some appeared.   This lead to a BUNCH of lay republicans as well as the trump campaign and some repub pundits claiming that “poll watchers” “weren’t allowed” into polls, therefore “fraud.” They’re not talking about the legitimate ones, though it’s obviously muddied due to using the same term for two different things.   All polls have been officially and legally watched by people from both republican and Democratic parties the entire time.',\n",

You guys all think that it’s just dems doing that but you will all be shooting yourselves in the foot.  In my two precincts both were Trumps.  Everyone working there was a democrat. When we are working we are very proud to make sure that we count every vote.  See for us, it’s not that serious.  We dealt with Trump for 4 years.  Most of us were well prepared to deal another 4. We had no issue and we definitely didn’t feel we needed to cheat to win. I think the USA was really tired of things the president would say to divide the nation.  I really don’t have a problem with republicans.  My best friend voted Trump.  Many people in my family voted for him. It’s probably why he won Florida.  I honestly don’t feel any anger or violence and I wouldn’t have felt that if Trump would be winning.  I feel we don’t take it as seriously as all of you do. Do we want it? Sure.  Would we kill for it? No.  Would we cheat for it and make ourselves look like frauds?  No. We don’t want another Bush. Let’s all just relax and try to move back to being united as a nation under God.  You know? Like it says in the pledge of allegiance?  I’m really tired of politics dividing people.

It’s not about being democrat or republican. It’s about other people staying the hell out of Georgia’s business. You elect your officials and we stay the hell out of it as well. If Georgia goes democrat, so be it. If Georgia goes republican, so be it. But this comes down to Georgia’s choice. I am appalled at the fact that there are people trying to insert theirselves in our elections.',\n",
       " 'Again, I understand what you’re saying and agree with you in principle. However, both sides are going to throw a disgusting amount of money into this race because that is how American politics work.   As for your first question the main thing I want is our president to be able to enact measures to help our country defeat this terrible virus and get back on our feet. I’m interested in the financial sector and there have been numerous individuals who are much smarter than me (JPow mainly) who say we are on the verge of an economic collapse if we do not take measures (i.e stimulus) to prevent that. Mitch will be an obstructionist piece of shit like he has been if he is given the power too.   So honestly, the legislation I want to see happen involves rona relief, economic stimulus, and I’d personally like to see weed decriminalized.',\n",
       " 'It gives me relief to know that you agree in principle. I see too many people these days wanting to disrupt our political processes in order to achieve their goals. History shows that those types of governments never last.   I think that many older are what put biden in office. Being scared of the virus. Truthfully, I do not believe Biden will help us beat this virus. After all, trump has not been sittin on his ass with this virus, he made some major plays against regulation in order to get vaccines and aid to people. Definitely not talked about. I sort of agree with you about stimulus, but Nancy pelosi is really the problem with this whole thing. I believe biden knows this as well. Trump wanted to make a deal, he even told her to bring him something without all the extra stuff she has in it and he would sign it because he wants to get money to people. He said they could work out the other stuff she wanted later but not to waste anymore time on aid for the people. She refused and here we are. Honestly she needs replacing. Also, we must be careful listening to some of these large financial corporations. Many of these have money tied up with other large sectors that are pushing for “aid”. Like personally I don’t believe in bailing out the airlines. I think it’s unfortunate what has happened to them but we need to let market determine what survives. Part of the reason we have seen virus after virus in the last 20 years is because of airline travel.   I am also a fan of a divided government in some sense. Too much power to a political party, especially in the age of hyper specialization and reconditioning of political views hi youtube, Twitter, news, etc., is dangerous. For example if you hate trump ( for fair political reasons and not media slander) then you wouldn’t want a republican senate and house, then your worst nightmares get passed and a wedge is driven between you and your brethren across the arbitrary political line. Mitch McConnell is very good at what he does and I think it is favorable for him to stay majority leader through the Biden presidency. I believe it is the only way we don’t swing too far left in a country that obviously has a ton of people who wouldn’t support that. The vice versa is true for me too. I wouldn’t want the country to swing too far right. That would be a disaster. Sorry for the rant, you seem like a very reasonable person.  I would also like to see weed decriminalized. I am very surprised that the federal government has done little to nothing on it when the states that have legalized it seem to do well. It actually shocks me that it hasn’t been talked about.',\n",

You may not believe this, but say for example, any other state does not have a say in who Georgia votes for the senate. What I have a problem with is people suggesting that they “Georgia needs to do this” and so on. I am not 100% saying that is what you are implying, but if you are saying that people outside the state have to give any effort into who Georgia elects, then I have a big problem with that. People can have opinions sure, but I just want you to understand that I truly support states being able to elect who they want without support or input from other states.

Because what got lost in the shuffle is that turnout in cities has been abysmal. Yes Detroit gave Michigan to Biden. But turnout was 50% of registered voters. Most people in cities like Detroit have given up on politics, because they feel none of them care about them.  That is where I firmly agree with Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang. Democrats need to make damn sure they show everyone in America that they're there to help. And they need to make sure they're helping everywhere. It's not enough to have a Democrat in power, it needs to be a good one, and if it's not they need to be replaced or defeated in a primary.\",\n",

The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process.  Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.  &#x200B;  “Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election. It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters. Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room – and then fight in court to block their access.    &#x200B;  “So what is Biden hiding?

I spent years hearing the bad faith lies of complicit conservatives in my family and office who asserted Obama separated families too. The 1997 Flores Settlement outlines how migrant children in US custody are treated, under Jeff Sessions and outed white nationalist Stephen Miller, the trump admin gutted this settlement and separated an estimated 5000 children. Many children reported sexual assault and too many died. Some children will never see their parents again. The right's megaphone, that they used for careless lies, conspiracy, and abuse, is coming to a close. Trump separated those kids, placed them in camps, used their bodies as a political prop, not anyone else.    You will see a lot of kumbaya on reddit in the coming days. I am not shaking any extended hands unless I see acknowledgment, of the crimes, cowardice, and the truth.
